All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [4.0.6] - Unreleased
### Added
- Add an option to format settings that allows emulating weekly format in a way
  where top level sections will be named after weeks. This does not apply to subsections.

## [4.0.5] - 2023-08-08
### Fixed
- When scrolling the page, the course index now correctly highlights subsections.
  Thanks to [luttje](https://github.com/luttje) for the patch submitted in

- Fixed unexpected scrolling when expanding a section in accordion mode.
### Added
- Course level settings for 'accordion' effect, 'Back to...' link and how to
  show the course index. (In addition to site-level settings added in v4.0.4)
- In accordion mode clicking on the section in the course index will expand
  it in the course contents.

## [4.0.4] - 2023-07-02
### Added
- Setting to show header for the General section and make it collapsible
- Link 'Add section' between sections (only for the top-level sections on the
  current page)
- Setting how to show the course index (sections and activities, only sections,
  do not display)
- Setting to enable 'accordion' effect - when one section is expanded, all others
  are collapsed
- Setting to display 'Back to...' link inside the activities allowing to return
  back to the course section
- Setting 'maxsections' now only affects the number of top-level sections. Number
  of subsections is unlimited (there is also a setting about the maximum depth).
### Fixed

  section is empty
